# pycaret-project
**Phase 1: Explore PyCaret**
Introduction to PyCaret:

1. Install PyCaret and get familiar with its functionalities.
2. Explore PyCaret's documentation to understand the available features.
3. Load Data and EDA:
4. Use PyCaret to load a sample dataset.
5. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using PyCaret's built-in functions.
6. Visualize data distributions, correlations, and other relevant insights.
7. Train Machine Learning Models:
8. Train multiple machine learning models using PyCaret's setup and compare_models functions.
9. Understand PyCaret's AutoML capabilities for model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
10. Evaluate model performance and compare different algorithms.

 **Phase 2: Build Your Package**

1. Define Package Structure:
               Create` a new Python package structure with appropriate directories (e.g., data, eda, models, app).

2. Load Data Module:

              - Implement a module to load data from various sources (e.g., CSV, Excel, databases).
              - Ensure flexibility in handling different data formats and structures.

3. EDA Module:
             - Develop a module for EDA, allowing users to perform common data exploration tasks.
             - Create visualizations and statistical summaries to help users understand their data.

4. Machine Learning Module:
            - Build a module that automatically selects appropriate models for regression or classification tasks.
            - Allow users to customize model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

5. Streamlit Web App:
            - Use Streamlit to create a simple web app.
            - Enable users to upload their data, select the target variable, and choose machine learning models.
            - Integrate the data loading, EDA, and machine learning modules into the app.

**Phase 3: Test and Validate**

1. Test Your Package:
            - Test your package on multiple datasets with varying characteristics.
            - Ensure that your package works seamlessly and produces meaningful results.
